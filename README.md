# ADA_MTE_PROJECT
- In this project, the concept of backtracking is used. - The project is done in python.  Problem Statement - User has to provide the size of the matrix that is the `number of rows` and `number of columns.` - The matrix will be generated automatically using the `random` library of python. - The matrix will only contain values `1` and `0` in it.  - There is a condition that we can move to the neighboring cell only if that cell has value `1` in it. - If there is `0` in the neighboring cell, it means that we cannot pass through that cell and, we have to take another route. - Here, another route means any neighboring cell which has value `1`. - We have to find all possible paths from the first cell `array[0][0]` to the last column of the matrix `array[x][n].` - Also, we have to print some of the sample paths.
